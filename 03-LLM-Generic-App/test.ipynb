For farmers, especially small and marginal farmers, and other \\nmarginalised sections, the government is promoting cooperative-based \\neconomic development model. A new Ministry of Cooperation was formed \\nwith a mandate to realise the vision of ‘Sahakar Se Samriddhi’ . To realise \\nthis vision, the government has already initiated computerisation of 63,000 \\nPrimary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) with an investment of ` 2,516 \\ncrore. In consultation with all stakeholders and states, model bye-laws for \\nPACS were formulated enabling them to become multipurpose PACS. A \\nnational cooperative database is being prepared for country-wide mapping \\nof cooperative societies.  \\n26. With this backdrop, we will implement a plan to set up massive \\ndecentralised storage capacity.
