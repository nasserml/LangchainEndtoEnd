# LangChain: Natural Language Processing Q&A Chatbot Using LLM Project

This repository showcases various components of a Natural Language Processing project using OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Python tools.

## Introduction
LangChain provides a comprehensive example of leveraging different NLP models and tools to perform various tasks. The project includes:

- Interaction with OpenAI's GPT-3 model to answer questions and generate text.
- Utilization of Hugging Face's Transformer models for text generation and analysis.
- Building chains for sequential and parallel processing of text-based tasks.
- Chatbot functionality that leverages AI for generating humorous content.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Demonstrates the use of OpenAI's GPT-3 through a Streamlit-based Q&A chatbot interface.
- `langchain.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing interactions with OpenAI and Hugging Face models.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the necessary Python packages for running the project.
- `.gitignore`: File to exclude certain files from version control.
- `LICENSE`: Details the project's licensing information.
- `.env`: Configuration file for setting API keys and other environment variables.
- Directory structure for the code's execution.
